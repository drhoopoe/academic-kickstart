My name is Noah Gardiner and I'm an Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at the [University of South Carolina](https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/religious_studies/index.php), and this is my personal academic blog. I teach on a range of subjects relating to Islam and the academic study of religion. My primary research interests are Sufism, Islamic occultism, the science of letters and names (a.k.a. "lettrism"), and Islamic manuscripts and manuscript cultureâ€”all with a focus on the late-medieval Mediterranean and its diasporas. You can view most of my publications at my [academia.edu page](https://sc.academia.edu/NoahGardiner). **This blog** will touch on things related to my research and a bunch of other stuff I'm interested in, like the humanities crisis, ontologies theory, science fiction, anarchism, Linux and FOSS, and God knows what else.
