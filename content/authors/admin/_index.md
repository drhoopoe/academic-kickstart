My name is Noah Gardiner and I'm an Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at the [University of South Carolina](https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/religious_studies/index.php), and this is my personal academic blog. I teach on a range of subjects relating to Islam and the academic study of religion. My primary research interests are in late-medieval Sufism, Islamic occultism, the science of letters and names (a.k.a. "lettrism"), and Islamic manuscripts and manuscript cultureâ€”all with a focus on the Arabic-speaking Mediterranean and its diasporas. You can view most of my publications at my [academia.edu page](https://sc.academia.edu/NoahGardiner). **This blog** will touch on things related to my research and a bunch of other stuff I'm interested in, like the humanities crisis, ontologies theory, science fiction, anarchism, Linux and FOSS, and God knows what else.
