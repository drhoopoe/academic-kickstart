Noah Gardiner is an Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at the University of South Carolina, teaching on a range of subjects relating to Islam and the academic study of religion. His primary research interests are in Sufism, Islamic occultism, the science of letters and names (a.k.a. lettrism), and Islamic manuscript studies and manuscript culture, all with a focus on the late-medieval Islamic Mediterranean.

This blog is will touch on all the topics mentioned above, but also other stuff Noah is interested in, which most recently is a bunch of FOSS and Linux stuff.
