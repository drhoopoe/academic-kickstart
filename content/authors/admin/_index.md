Noah Gardiner is an Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at the University of South Carolina, teaching on a range of subjects relating to Islam and the academic study of religion. His primary research interests are in late-medieval Sufism, Islamic occultism, the science of letters and names (a.k.a. "lettrism"), and Islamic manuscripts and manuscript culture, all with a focus on the Arabic-speaking Islamic Mediterranean and its diasporas.

This blog touches on all the topics mentioned above, as well other stuff Noah is interested in: the humanities crisis, ontologies theory, science fiction, anarchism, FOSS and Linux, and God knows what else.
