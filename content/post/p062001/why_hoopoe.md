## Introduction

The hoopoe ( *Upupa epops*, Ar. *al-hudhud*) is a colorful, crested, long-beaked migratory bird that ranges across many of the hot parts of Eurasia and Africa. 
It's charming, obviously, but why name a personal academic blog with a focus on Islamic occultism and Sufism after it?

Certainly I could have gone the safer route and just registered myname.com, but where's the fun is that? I prefered something that would be evocative of the topics I work on, at least for those with ears to hear.

So how does this funny-looking little bird accomplish that? By being a transhistorical, transconfessional emblem of occult and mystical power, of course.

## The hoopoe in Islamic sources

Part of what lends the hoopoe its symbolic potency, at least in Islamic thought, is that it's one of only three birds mentioned by name in the Qurʾan.[^1]
This occurs in a story in Sūrat al-Naml ([Q 27:15-44](https://quran.com/27/15-44)) about everyone's favorite prophet-magician-king, Solomon (Sulaymān), and his encounter with Bilqīs, the queen of Sheba (Sabaʾ, i.e. eastern Yemen).

```
The hoopoe's initial absence is due to it's being in Yemen gathering intelligence on Bilqīs, but it quickly returns to report on this queen of a nation of sun-worshipping pagans, later shuttling messages back and forth between the two rulers. 
In the end, Solomon succeeds in guiding Bilqīs to the worship of God, though only by dispatching his jinn to whisk her magnificent throne away from her palace in Maʿrib and into his in Jerusalem. 

A good deal of solar and cosmological symbolism attends this story of prophethood, kingship, divine guidance, and jinn possessed of preternatural powers, and all these themes tend to rub off on the hoopoe in Islamic thought. 
One of the bird's most famous roles in Islamic literature, for example, is in Farīd al-Dīn ʿAttār's *Conference of the Birds* ( *Manṭiq al-ṭayr*).[^2]
In this extended allegory of the Sufi path, in which a disparate flock of birds journeys in search of their mysterious king, Simurgh, the hoopoe takes on the role of far-seeing guide and spiritual counselor.
That is, it becomes the symbol of the Sufi shaykh who sees across the visible and invisible worlds and uses this insight to lead others to inner knowledge of God.

## ...and in other sources

The Qurʾan was far from the only source of stories and ideas about the hoopoe in Afro-Eurasian thought. 
As numerous scholars have discussed, hoopoes can be found engraven on temple walls in Old Kingdom Egypt; in histories, plays, and medical texts from ancient Greece and Rome; and in numerous works on magic from the late antique, medieval and early modern periods.[^3] 
In many of these contexts the hoopoe is associated with the sun and kingship (much like in the Qurʾan), with fertility and filial piety, and with spiritual and occult power.
One scholar has even tried to link the bird's name to the Greek mystery cults, arguing that the Greek *epops* was associated with the word *epopteia*, "beholding," which held a special ritual meaning in those groups.[^4]

Not all references to hoopoes are positive.
They are twice mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as unclean animals forbidden to be eaten.[^5] 
It is genrally agreed upon that they smell terrible, too, though the meaning of this is debated. 
Modern Yemeni medico-magical practitioners interviewed by anthropologist Nancy Dupree, for example, argue that God gave the hoopoe its foul smell to protect it from humans seeking to capture or kill it in order to exploit its wondrous properties.[^6]

A pseudo-Hermetic text known as the *Cyranides*, thought to have originated in the fourth century C.E., is perhaps the oldest surviving witness for ideas about the extraordinary magical and medical powers of various parts of the hoopoe's body.
Suffice to say that none of the procedures it describes end well for the bird.
The *Cyranides* was translated into Latin and other European languages in the Middle Ages, and into Arabic by no later than the fourteenth century, and it was just one of many texts that advised slaughtering hoopoes for their special bits and pieces.[^7] 

According to the canonical *ḥadīth* collection *Sunan Abī Dāwūd*, the hoopoe is one of just four animals the Prophet Muḥammad explicitly forbade Muslims to ever kill,[^8] 
Given the popularity of these ideas, however, it seems that this didn't always suffice to protect the bird among Muslims in search of magico-medical remedies. 
Indeed, a recent paper by a group of Iranian researchers laments that the bird is practically extinct in some regions of Iran due the continuing prevalence of such practices.[^9]
