## Introduction

The hoopoe (*Upupa epops*, Ar. *al-hudhud*) is a long-beaked, colorfully crested migratory bird that ranges across many hot parts of Eurasia and Africa. 
It's charming, obviously, but why name an academic blog with a focus on Islamic occultism and Sufism after it?

I could have gone the safer route and just registered myname.com, but how boring is that? I instead preferred something that would be evocative of the sort of subjects I work on, at least for those with ears to hear.
So how does this funny-looking little bird accomplish that? Well, in short, by being an age-old Afro-Eurasian emblem of occult and mystical power.



## The hoopoe in Islamic sources

In Islamic thought, a big part of what lends the hoopoe its symbolic potency is that it's one of only three birds mentioned by name in the Qurʾān.[^1]
This occurs in a story in Sūrat al-Naml ([Q 27:15-44](https://quran.com/27/15-44)) about everyone's favorite prophet-magician-king, Solomon (Sulaymān), and his encounter with Bilqīs, the queen of Sheba (Sabaʾ, ancient eastern Yemen). 

The beginning of the story finds Solomon gathering his armies of humans, jinn, and animals and wondering where the hell exactly is the hoopoe...

{{< figure library="true" src="Q27-20.jpg" title="And he \(Solomon\) surveyed the birds and said, Why do I not see the hoopoe? Or is it among the absent? - Qurʾān 27\:20" lightbox="true" >}}

The hoopoe's not there at the outset because it's in Yemen gathering intelligence on Bilqīs. 
Perhaps sensing Solomon's displeasure, it returns in the blink of an eye to report on this queen of a nation of sun-worshipping pagans.
It then spends several verses shuttling messages back and forth between the two rulers. 
In the end, Solomon succeeds in guiding Bilqīs to the worship of God, though only by dispatching his jinn to whisk her magnificent throne away from her palace in Maʿrib and into his in Jerusalem. 
A good deal of solar and other cosmological symbolism attends this story of prophethood, kingship, a talking bird (or really, a king who speaks bird), and spirit-beings possessed of preternatural powers, and all these themes tend to adhere to the hoopoe in later Islamic thought. 

For example, one of the bird's most famous roles in Islamic literature is in the thirteenth-century Persian Sufi poet Farīd al-Dīn ʿAttār's *Conference of the Birds* (*Manṭiq al-ṭayr*).[^2]
In this extended allegory of the Sufi path, in which a mixed flock of birds journeys in search of their mysterious bird-king Simurgh, the hoopoe takes on the role of far-seeing guide and spiritual counselor to its fellow avians.
That is, it becomes the symbol of the Sufi shaykh who sees across the visible and invisible worlds and uses this insight to lead others to inner knowledge of God.
Not to leave powerful spirit-beings out of the story, ʿAṭṭār supplies the detail that the hoopoe became Solomon's confidante by defeating a demon.

## And in other sources

The Qurʾān was far from the only source of stories and ideas about the hoopoe in Afro-Eurasian thought. 
As numerous scholars have discussed, hoopoes can be found on temple walls in Old Kingdom Egypt; in histories, plays, and medical texts from ancient Greece and Rome; and in numerous works on magic and medicine from the late antique, medieval and early modern periods.[^3] 

Across these various milieus, the hoopoe is frequently associated with the sun and kingship (much like in the Qurʾān), often with fertility and filial piety, and almost always with spiritual and occult power.
One scholar has argued, for example, that the Greek *epops* ("hoopoe") was associated etymologically with the word *epopteia*, "beholding," a term that often implied visionary forms of knowledge, particularly in the context of the Greek mystery cults.[^4] 
Whatever the merits of this particular argument, the interplay of the visible and invisible indeed is a key theme in ideas and stories about the hoopoe.

Not all references to the hoopoe are positive.
It is twice mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as an unclean animal forbidden to be eaten.[^5] 
This may help explain why an enormous and somewhat sinister-looking hoopoe appears at the left edge of the center panel of [Hieronymus Bosch's "The Garden of Earthly Delights"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights_by_Bosch_High_Resolution.jpg.").
It's also widely agreed upon that the hoopoe literally stinks, though the meanings attributed to this can differ. 
Yemeni medico-magical practitioners interviewed by anthropologist Nancy Dupree in the 1970s, for example, argued that God gave the hoopoe its foul odor to protect it from humans seeking to capture or kill it in order to exploit its wondrous properties.[^6]

A pseudo-Hermetic text known as the *Cyranides*, parts of which date to the fourth century C.E., is perhaps the oldest surviving testament to the idea that various parts of the hoopoe's body are possessed of magical and medicinal properties.
The text traveled far and wide for over a millennium in Latin, Arabic, and other languages. 
Suffice to say that none of the procedures it recommends end well for the hoopoe,[^7] and it was just one of many texts that advised slaughtering the bird for its special bits.[^8] 
According to the canonical *ḥadīth* collection *Sunan Abī Dāwūd*, the hoopoe is one of just four animals the Prophet Muḥammad explicitly forbade Muslims to kill[^9] 
Given the popularity of the aforementioned texts and practices, however, this hasn't always sufficed to protect it from being hunted in Muslim-majority locales. 
Of course, this combination of venerating and slaughtering an animal is hardly unique to the hoopoe in the annals of human history.


## Conclusion

The little hoopoe bird thus captures much of what this blog aims to be about. 
That is, the interwoven threads of occult and mystical ideas and practices that span the *longue durée* of Afro-Eurasian thought and culture and extend well into our world today.
