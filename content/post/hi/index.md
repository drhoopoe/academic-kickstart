This is a test post. Let's see how all the *markdown* stuff works. Can
- I
- make 
- a 
- list
and **bold** things?
And can I add link to something like [that Bistami article I wrote](https://www.academia.edu/35528459/The_Occultist_Encyclopedism_of_%CA%BFAbd_al-Rahman_al-Bistami._Mamluk_Studies_Review_20_2017_3-38)?

If so then this it's super easy to use this editor.
